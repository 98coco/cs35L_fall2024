From the readings about git log, we know that git log has the option -S. When using the git log -S "string", can help us find when the very first commit of the string we put right next to it was introduced. It also gives us a log of all the other occurrences of the string if it was modified. 

Thus, to find how the statement "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.", I used the following:

git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

I got the following result:
