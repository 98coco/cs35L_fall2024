When doing git branch within the repository we cloned, the resulting output is:

* master

When doing git branch within the repository ~eggert/src/github/git, the resulting output is:

  maint
* master
  next
  seen
  todo

This means that ~eggert/src/github/git has more branches than the clone of git's own repository. 
In our clone of git's own repo, it only has one branch and that is the master branch.
